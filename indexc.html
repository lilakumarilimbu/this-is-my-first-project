    <p class="paragraph">Perfume is a fragrant liquid typically made from a blend of essential oils, aroma compounds, alcohol, and water. It is used to give a pleasant scent to the human body, surroundings, or objects. The art of perfumery dates back to ancient civilizations, such as Egypt and Mesopotamia, where it was used in religious rituals and personal grooming. A perfume is composed of three layers of scent: the top notes, which are the initial, light impression; the middle or heart notes, which form the core aroma; and the base notes, which linger the longest and provide depth. Perfumes are categorized based on their concentration levels ranging from parfum, which has the highest concentration of fragrance oils, to body mists, which are the lightest and most subtle. Additionally, fragrances are classified into families like floral, fruity, woody, citrus, and oriental, each evoking different moods and sensations. When applying perfume, it's best to target pulse points like the wrists, neck, and behind the ears, allowing the scent to naturally diffuse with body heat. The experience of perfume can vary greatly from person to person due to individual body chemistry, making it a deeply personal and expressive accessory.
